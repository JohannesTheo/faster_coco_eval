## Contributing

All kinds of contributions are welcome, including but not limited to the following.

- Fix typo or bugs
- Add documentation or translate the documentation into other languages
- Add new features and components

### Workflow

1. fork and pull the latest repository
2. checkout a new branch (do not use master branch for PRs)
3. commit your changes
4. create a PR

Note: If you plan to add some new features that involve large changes, it is encouraged to open an issue for discussion first.

### Code style

#### Python

We adopt [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as the preferred code style.

We use the following tools for linting and formatting:

- [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8): A wrapper around some linter tools.
- [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort): A Python utility to sort imports.

> Before you create a PR, make sure that your code lints and is formatted by black.
